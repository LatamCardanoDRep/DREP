    "comment": "We recognize the importance of a Net Change Limit (NCL) being approved to unlock the access to the treasury, but this must be made both with the highest quality standards and with the best economic analysis. Always having Cardano's resiliance as a top priority in mind.\n\nWe vote \"NO\" for 2 reasons:\n1. There us ambiguity in the term of the NCL being proposed. From the text it can be interpreted that it would last for 72 epochs but from the epochs described it would be 73 epochs. This lack of clarity apones the door to future governance problems. We invite proposers to resubmit this proposal without this error.\n\n2. We are convinced that the NCL should be determined as a percentage of the treasury's balance not as a fixed amount. This eliminates the necessity to guess future income tothe treasury providing aditional layer of resiliance to the treasury management."
